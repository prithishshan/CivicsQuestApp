Supp. 1967): A Missouri statute setting out how trustees are to be apportioned among the separate school districts. Briefly, the statutes provides that :if no one or more of the component school districts has [33.33%] or more of the total enumeration of the junior college district, then all six trustees are elected at large. If, however, one or more districts has between [33.33%] and 50% of the total enumeration, each such district elects two trustees and the rest are elected at large from the remaining districts. Similarly, if one district has between 50% and [66.66%] of the enumeration it elects three trustees, and if one district has more than [66.66%] it elects four trustees."" Therefore, the statute ""necessarily results in a systematic discrimination against voters in more populous school districts because whenever a large district's percentage of the total enumeration falls within a certain percentage range it is always allocated the number of trustees corresponding to the bottom of that range.""

The Court reasoned that, when this portion of § 772(f) is read together with 18 U.S.C. § 702, which made it a crime for any person without authority to wear any uniform of the United States military, the effect is a violation of an actor's constitutional right ""to say things that tend to bring the military into discredit or disrepute.""","First Amendment","Free Speech Clause"
